    <h1><b>I Wonder</b></h1>
    <p><b>And I'm back on my grind <br />
        A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime <br />
        My name would help light up the Chicago skyline <br />
        And that's why I'm (And I wonder) <br />
        Seven o'clock, that's primetime <br />
        Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines <br />
        Why he keep givin' me hot lines <br />?
        I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder) <br />
        How many ladies in the house? (If you know) <br />
        How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means) <br />
        Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused (What it means) <br />
        What you about? (And I wonder) <br />
        On that independent shit (If you know) <br />
        Trade it all for a husband and some kids (What it means) <br />
        You ever wonder what it all really mean? <br />
        You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?</b></p>
